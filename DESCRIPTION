Description: LESYMAP maps the specific brain areas responsible for
        cognitive deficits by taking a series of lesion maps and a
        vector of behavioral scores. Both univariate (t-test,
        Brunner-Munzel, regression) and multivariate (sparse canonical
        corelations) tests are available. LESYMAP is built to run both
        real and simulated lesion-to-symptom mapping analyses.
